Architecture
1. Layered Architecture
Presentation Layer: Handles the user interface and user interaction. This is where the views (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) reside, managed by the MVC controllers.
Business Logic Layer: Contains the core functionality and business rules. It processes user inputs, performs validations, and executes business logic.
Data Access Layer: Manages interactions with the database. It provides methods to perform CRUD operations and handle data persistence.
Data Layer: Represents the database schema and data models used by the Data Access Layer.
2. MVC Pattern
Model: Represents the data structure and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and processing data from the database.
View: The user interface components. It displays data to the user and provides forms for user input.
Controller: Manages user input and interacts with the Model to update the View. It handles the flow of data between the Model and the View.
